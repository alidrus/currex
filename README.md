## Build

The preferable tool to use is `yarn` although you can use `npm` if you want:

  ```
  yarn && yarn build
  ```
or,

  ```
  npm install && npm run build
  ```


## Install

In order to install the binary, run the following command:

  ```
  yarn install-bin ~/bin/
  ```

If you wish to install the executable binary in a different location you may do
so by replacing `~/bin` with the destination path of your choice.
